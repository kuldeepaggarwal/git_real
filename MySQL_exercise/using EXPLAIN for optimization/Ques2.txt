2.1 The value under 'rows' column in the output of EXPLAIN query and SELECT query after it are same. What does it mean?
answer- 
	The 'rows' column indicates the number of rows MySQL believes it must examine to execute the query and in this particular case
	the user_id column is not indexed so it searches for the user_id of 41 throughout the table searching in every row thereby explaining
	the number '1002345' which is the actual number of rows in the table.
	 


2.2 Is the SELECT query optimal? If no, how do we optimize it?
answer-
	No the query is not optimal.
	It can be optimized by adding an index to the user_Id column--
	ALTER TABLE comments ADD INDEX(user_id);
